@section Name

@b{netcfg} - start/stop/control network profiles



@section Synopsis

@b{netcfg} [@var{option}...]
@*
@b{netcfg} @var{profile}



@section Description

@b{netcfg} is used to configure and manage network connections via profiles.
It has pluggable support for a range of connection types, such as wireless,
ethernet, ppp. It is also capable of starting/stopping many to one connections,
that is, multiple connections within the same profile, optionally with bonding.

It may be run at boot, by  adding @command{net-profiles} to @var{DAEMONS} in
@file{/etc/rc.conf}, or, on systemd systems, by by enabling the @command{netcfg}
systemd service. After boot time, it may be used to start profiles, simply
by passing only the profile name.

When run without options, netcfg profile is equivalent to @command{netcfg -u}
profile.
