NETCFG(8)
=========

NAME
----
netcfg - start/stop/control network profiles


SYNOPSIS
--------
netcfg [_options_]

netcfg *profile*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*netcfg* is used to configure and manage network connections via
profiles. It has pluggable support for a range of connection types, such
as wireless, ethernet, ppp. It is also capable of starting/stopping many
to one connections, that is, multiple connections within the same
profile, optionally with bonding.

It may be run at boot, by enabling the 'netcfg' systemd service, or, on
legacy systems, by adding 'net-profiles' to +DAEMONS+ in '/etc/rc.conf'.
After boot time, it may be used to start profiles, simply by passing only
the profile name.

When run without options, `netcfg profile` is equivalent to `netcfg -u
profile`.
