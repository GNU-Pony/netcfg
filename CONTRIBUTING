That's awesome that you want to contribute!


If you have systemd or wireless contection
please prioritise those issed if you want
to try to patch something.

IF you are reporting an issue, it is too
bad that only maintainers can but labels
on issues and put them in milestones.
Therefore please classify them to whether
they concern systemd and to whether they
concern wireless connections; and what
severity you think the issue have. I
critical issue is an issue that stops
you from using netcfg, and medium is
the highest severity for systemd issue
(since netcfg is made for rc.d and not
systemd) and wireless connection issues
(since you can always just plug in the
wired connection.)
